# 🧪 Rust Exercises (Chapters 1–3)

## 1️⃣ Primitive Types Warm-Up

Create variables for the following and print them:

- A signed integer representing temperature (`i32`)
- An unsigned integer representing age (`u32`)
- A floating-point number representing price (`f64`)
- A boolean representing login status
- A character representing the first letter of your name

👉 Goal: get comfortable with **explicit typing**

---

## 2️⃣ Integer Ranges & Types

1. Create:

   - One `i32`
   - One `i64`

2. Assign them **large values**
3. Print both

👉 Question to answer in comments:

- Why would you choose `i64` over `i32`?

---

## 3️⃣ Array Basics

1. Create an array of **5 integers**
2. Print:

   - The whole array
   - The first element
   - The last element

👉 Bonus: What happens if you access index `5`?

---

## 4️⃣ Tuple Practice

Create a tuple that stores:

- Your name
- Your age
- Your height (decimal)

Print the entire tuple.

👉 Bonus:

- Destructure the tuple into separate variables and print them

---

## 5️⃣ Final Challenge (Mixed)

Write a small program that:

1. Stores:

   - Weight (`f64`)
   - Height (`f64`)

2. Uses a function to calculate BMI
3. Stores the result in a variable
4. Uses an `if` **expression** to:

   - Return `"Underweight"`, `"Normal"`, or `"Overweight"`

5. Prints the BMI **and** category

👉 This combines:

- Primitive types
- Functions
- Expressions
- Return values
